Queue is linear data structure follows a particular order in wich the operation are performed : FIFIO
*Operation Queue: 
enqueue:Add Item to the queue .
Dequeue:remove Item from the queue.
Front:get the front item from the queue.
Rear:get the the last item from the queue .

Array implementation of a queue : 

*Steps of Enqueue :
-check if the queue is full or not 
-if full print overflow and exit,
-else insert elment and increment tail .
*Steps of deque :
-check if queue is empty 
-if the queue is empty ,print queue is empty 
-print elment at the head and  increment the head .

Limitation of the queue : 
we can not use the addresse dequeue in the normal queue

*Circular Queue : 
Front :to track the first element
Rear: to track the last element
-enqueue : 
-check if the queue is full or not , if(Front==0 && rear=size-1 || rear+1=front)
-for the first elment set the front to 0 
-add the new to elment pointed by the Rear
-increase the rear
-dequeue : 
-check if the queue is empty,if (Front==-1)
-remove the new element from the queue
-increse the front pointer.
